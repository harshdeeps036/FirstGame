# First Game  

This is my first exposure to PyGame, where I have followed the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=4053s to re-create space invaders with a few twists.  
I have been working on my variational quantum random number generator, that you can find here: https://github.com/harshdeeps036/QiskitFallFest21-AU, all the randomization done is this game is via this quantum RNG, making the game just a little bit quantum.
